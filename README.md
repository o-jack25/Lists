# Lists

In main1.cpp, I was to write a main() routine in which you allocate noes and create the following linked list: 33->45->58->81->nullptr. I wrote a function called listSize that takes a pointer to the start of a linked list and returns the number of elements in the list. Then, I had to write another function called listSum that also takes a pointer to the start of a linked list and returns the sum of the values of all elements in the list.

In main2.cpp, I was to assume nodes in a linked list are of class ListNode, except that the type of data is char. I had to write a main() routine in which I created the following linked list: G->O->B->L->U->E->!->nullptr. Then, I wrote a function called printList that takes a pointer to the start of a linked list and prints out all the nodes in the list in sequence. 

In main3.cpp, I had to revise main2.cpp and create a "Doubly-Linked List".

In main4.cpp, I was to design a template swap function.

In main5.cpp, I was to demonstrate pass-by-reference of a pointer variable. I designed a function makeAndFillArray() with 2 parameters. The first is a reference to a pointer variable that points to a one-dimensional dynamic array of type int, and the second parameter is an int called size which specifies the number of elements in the array. The makeAndFillArray function allocates a pointer variable, then allocates an array pointed to by variable, then fills the array with numbers equal to the index of the element (a[0]=0,a[1]=1). It is supposed to return a reference to the pointer to the array. Lastly, in main() I was to show how a pointer variable and array can be created by calling the makeAndFillArray() function. I was to call the function, get a pointer to an array of size 6, and have main print out the values of the array.
